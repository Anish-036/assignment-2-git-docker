## TASK 1: Variables and Data Types

full_name = "Anish Budhathoki"
age = 22
cgpa = 3.8
current_semester = 6
is_enrolled = True


print(full_name, type(full_name))
print(age, type(age))
print(cgpa, type(cgpa))
print(current_semester, type(current_semester))
print(is_enrolled, type(is_enrolled))

## reassigning values to the variables

age = "Tewnty Two"

print(age, type(age))


## Reasoning Question Answer:

#1 Python uses dynamic typing, meaning that memory allocation at runtime. 
    ### This allows flexibility but can cause runtime errors.

#2 System level software needs strict type enforcement for performance.
    #### memory safety andd predictability, unlike scripting languages.
